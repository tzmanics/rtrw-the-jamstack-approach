# (σﾟ∀ﾟ)σ Render the Right Way - Demo

This is the base project we'll use in our [Render the Right Way Workshop](https://github.com/tzmanics/workshop-rendering-the-right-way). Here are two ways to make this project all yours:

1. Push that 'Use this template' ԅ(´ڡ`ԅ) button at the top of this repo 
2. Locally run `git clone https://github.com/tzmanics/rtrw-demo`, then create a new repo in your git account and push it on up there.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
